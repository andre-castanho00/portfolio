              I'm a passionate Full Stack Engineer with 5+ years of experience
              building scalable web applications and digital solutions. I
              specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks, cloud technologies,
              and creating seamless user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, with a
              strong focus on writing clean, maintainable code and following
              best practices. I enjoy solving complex problems and turning ideas
              into reality through technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
              contributing to open source projects, or sharing knowledge with
              the developer community.
